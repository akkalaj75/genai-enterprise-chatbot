🤖 WHAT WE BUILT,Overview,"We created a smart chatbot that answers questions about company documents using Artificial Intelligence (AI)"
🤖 WHAT WE BUILT,Simple Analogy,"Think of it like having a helper robot that reads all your company papers and remembers them, so whenever you ask a question, it can look through those papers and give you the answer!"
📱 HOW IT WORKS,The Chatbot App,"It's a program that runs on a computer, listens for questions from people, and sends back answers"
📱 HOW IT WORKS,Smart Reading System (RAG),"RAG = Retrieval Augmented Generation. It means: Find information + Give smart answers. Like when you search for something in a book AND then explain it in your own words"
📱 HOW IT WORKS,AI Brain,"Uses Azure OpenAI (a super-smart AI from Microsoft). It's like having a really smart tutor that understands questions and can write natural answers that make sense"
📱 HOW IT WORKS,Security System,"Uses JWT Tokens (secret passwords). Only lets logged-in users ask questions. Admin can log in with: admin / admin123"
💻 TECHNOLOGY USED,Programming Language,Python 🐍 - The computer language we used to build everything. Like the language a robot understands
💻 TECHNOLOGY USED,Web Framework,"FastAPI ⚡ - This lets people access the chatbot through the internet. Like the front desk of a building that handles visitors"
💻 TECHNOLOGY USED,Storage & Documents,"Stored in sample_docs folder: company_policy.txt (Rules of the company), benefits_info.txt (What workers get)"
💻 TECHNOLOGY USED,AI Services,"Azure OpenAI - The super-smart AI brain, FAISS - Helps find similar documents quickly (like an index in a book)"
💻 TECHNOLOGY USED,Testing,"Pytest - Tests to make sure everything works (like a checklist)"
